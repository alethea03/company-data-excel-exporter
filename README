STF Company Product Info Exporter

A simple and efficient Python GUI tool that allows you to enter company and product details, display the full structured data, and copy it directly to your clipboard — Excel-ready.

FEATURES
--------
- Input company name, product name, and product number
- Automatically generate a formatted product reference block
- View the entire formatted data before copying
- One-click "Copy to Clipboard" for easy Excel pasting

SAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT

Each product is stacked and separated by a new line — making it directly pasteable into Excel cells.
